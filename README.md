# Pre-Interview Coding Challenge

## CHALLENGE #2

### Summary
We have a nested dictionary/Json, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

***Example Inputs***

object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}

key = a/b/c

value = d

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}

key = x/y/z

value = a

### Hints

We would like to see some tests.

We would expect it in any other language. (Prefer Python)

Please don’t use any libraries for this challenge.
